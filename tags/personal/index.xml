      <description>So, a few weeks ago I decided to create my personal blog. Nothing fancy, mostly just a place to share the things I do in my nerd time. Conveniently creating this blog is in itself one of the nerdy things I can write about. But I´ll safe that for another day.
This post is meant to introduce myself. I´m a 31-year-old guy born near Freiburg and living in Stuttgart. I like doing and watching sports, hanging out with friends and family, cooking and reading books on my kindle.</description>
