      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, a few weeks ago I decided to create my personal blog. Nothing fancy, mostly just a place to share the things I do in my nerd time. Conveniently creating this blog is in itself one of the nerdy things I can write about. But I´ll safe that for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is meant to introduce myself.
I´m a 31-year-old guy born near Freiburg and living in Stuttgart. I like doing and watching sports, hanging out with friends and family, cooking and reading &lt;del&gt;books&lt;/del&gt; on my kindle. Between weekends I work as a software engineer for one of the two car companies in this town.
I´m a very curious type of guy. I like to dip my toe in new concepts and technologies - be it hardware or software - with a focus on unobstrusive solutions that still upgrade some inconvenient thing in my everyday life.
Examples: discreet home automation, a smart mirror or a more beautiful shell for one of my Sonos speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as I said initially: nothing fancy. But maybe still interesting for some of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sebastian&lt;/p&gt;
